salsa sales basic programme using cpp

<h1>Question</h1>
Write a program that lets a maker of chips and salsa keep track of sales for five different types of salsa: mild, medium, sweet, hot and zesty. The program should use two parallel 5-elements array: an array of strings that holds the five salsa names and an array of integers that holds the number of jars sold during the past month for each salsa type. The salsa names should be stored using an initialization list at the time the array is created. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of jars sold for each type. Once this sales data has been entered, the program should produce a report that displays sales for each salsa type, total sales, and the names of the highest selling and lower selling products.
